The goal of this project is to develop a complete interface for Trion World's RIFT Mobile App API. 

**Currently it can**:

* Authenticate and login
* List characeters on the account
* Look for available scratch off points
* Determine time remaining until next scratch off card (every hour you get a new one, accumulating up to only six at a time)
* Actually automate the scratch off process including: replaying and redeeming rewards. (Limited to the first type of scratch off, "Planar Rewards")

Although these features are planned, **currently it cannot**:

* Be run without a proxy (*details further down this document*)
* Listen to guild chat
* Send messages to guild chat
* Do more scratch offs than the "Planar Rewards" scratch off type.

And maybe some other things, if I think of them.

In order this use this, you currently need a proxy to run through. I recommend Charles Web Debugging Proxy. This code will not currently run without a proxy. You will also need to enable SSL debugging for all domains and all ports with Charles.

Beyond that, here's how to use it in it's current state:

*If you have a RIFT Mobile Authenticator, it is not required for use of their API.*

The following command will list characters and their character IDs:

	ruby ./bin/rift_scratch_offs.rb [rift_email] [rift_password]

The following command will do 1 scratch off with the character ID provided:

	ruby ./bin/rift_scratch_offs.rb [rift_email] [rift_password] [character_id]

The following command will do all 6 scratch offs (or how many are left available) with the character ID provided:

	ruby ./bin/rift_scratch_offs.rb [rift_email] [rift_password] [character_id] 6
	
Keep in mind this project will be constantly evolving and could break with anything that Trion does with their API.
